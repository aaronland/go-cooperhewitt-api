# go-cooperhewitt-api

Too soon. Move along.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make bin
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

## Tools

### ch-api

```
./bin/ch-api -param access_token=TOKEN -param method=cooperhewitt.labs.whatWouldMicahSay
